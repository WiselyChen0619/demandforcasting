⭐ **Best Model**: 14-day Moving Average (lowest MAE)

#### Detailed Model Comparison

##### 1. Moving Average Models
**Strengths:**
- Simple and interpretable
- Very fast computation (<1 second)
- No hyperparameter tuning required
- Robust to outliers
- Works well for stable demand patterns

**Weaknesses:**
- Cannot capture seasonality explicitly
- No trend extrapolation
- Assumes recent past represents future
- Poor for long-term forecasts

**Performance Analysis:**
- 7-day MA: Too reactive to short-term fluctuations (MAE: 1,810)
- 14-day MA: Optimal balance between responsiveness and stability (MAE: 1,589)
- 30-day MA: Too smooth, misses weekly patterns (MAE: 1,617)

##### 2. SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA)
**Strengths:**
- Explicitly models seasonality (weekly pattern captured)
- Handles both trend and seasonal components
- Statistical foundation with confidence intervals
- Good for regular seasonal patterns

**Weaknesses:**
- Requires stationarity assumption
- Complex parameter selection (p,d,q,P,D,Q,s)
- Longer training time (15 seconds)
- Sensitive to outliers
- May overfit with limited data

**Performance Analysis:**
- Successfully captured 7-day seasonality
- MAE of 1,648 shows good but not best performance
- RMSE of 2,105 (lowest) indicates consistent predictions

##### 3. Prophet (Facebook's Model)
**Strengths:**

## 4. Advanced Model Analysis

### 4.1 Why Simple Models Outperformed Complex Ones

The surprising result of Moving Average outperforming sophisticated models reveals important characteristics of our data:

1. **Stable Demand Patterns**: The shipment data shows relatively stable patterns without complex trends
2. **Short-term Dependencies**: Recent history (14 days) contains most predictive information
3. **Limited Training Data**: 4 months may be insufficient for complex models to learn effectively
4. **Noise vs Signal**: Simple models better filter noise in operational data

### 4.2 Model Behavior Analysis

#### Moving Average (14-day)
- **Prediction Pattern**: Flat forecast at recent average
- **Best For**: Stable operations with minimal growth
- **Risk**: Misses sudden trend changes

#### SARIMA
- **Prediction Pattern**: Captures weekly ups and downs
- **Best For**: Regular seasonal business cycles
- **Risk**: Over-emphasizes past seasonal patterns

#### Prophet
- **Prediction Pattern**: Smooth trend with weekly seasonality
- **Best For**: Growing businesses with clear patterns
- **Risk**: May extrapolate trends too aggressively

### 4.3 Ensemble Strategy Deep Dive

Our ensemble combined Prophet and 14-day MA using simple averaging:
```
Ensemble = 0.5 × Prophet + 0.5 × MA_14
```

**Performance Improvement Areas:**
1. **Weighted Ensemble**: Optimize weights based on recent performance
2. **Stacking**: Use another model to combine predictions
3. **Dynamic Selection**: Switch models based on conditions

### 4.4 Future Model Enhancements

#### Recommended Models for Iteration 2:
1. **XGBoost/LightGBM**: Can capture non-linear patterns
2. **LSTM/GRU**: Deep learning for complex sequences
3. **Transformer Models**: State-of-the-art for time series
4. **Hybrid Models**: Combine statistical and ML approaches

#### Feature Engineering Opportunities:
- Day of week indicators
- Month/quarter indicators  
- Lagged features (t-1, t-7, t-14)
- Rolling statistics
- External factors (holidays, events)
